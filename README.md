# GeoSpatial-Services

This project is intended for creating web software for domain specific systems. The domain under consideration is the geospatial systems. A geospatial system is a computing system capable of processing spatial data. In this project, the requirement was to create web mapping services using Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web standards. After developing the OGC web standard, a mobile app is to be developed for the visualisation of OGC web mapping services, Google
Maps and real time GPS data.
